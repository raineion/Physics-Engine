## Overview

Welcome to our Advanced Multi-Language Physics Engine, a versatile and powerful tool designed to simulate physical phenomena with high accuracy and efficiency. This engine is crafted to cater to a wide range of applications, from video games and animations to scientific simulations, providing developers with robust tools and algorithms for simulating objects, forces, collisions, and interactions in a virtual environment. Developed in C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript, our engine is built to integrate seamlessly into projects across different platforms and languages.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Crafted in C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript, enabling broad application across different development environments.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Ensures easy integration and extensibility within your projects.
- **Rigid Bodies and Constraints**: Supports a variety of physical bodies and constraints for comprehensive simulations.
- **Collision Detection and Resolution**: Implements advanced algorithms for accurate detection and resolution of collisions.
- **Efficient Simulation Methods**: Provides integration methods for motion simulation, alongside efficient broad-phase and narrow-phase collision detection.
- **Physical Properties**: Simulates friction, restitution, and other physical properties to enhance realism.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Includes thorough documentation and sample projects to kickstart your development.

Program	description:    Create your own simple First Person Perspective game. The game must include hazards for the player to avoid. A scoring
                        system must also be included. You must build your own graphic and sound assets. You must use ThreeJS and a JavaScript
                        Physics Engine to build your game.
Revision history:       added comments and some keyboard functionality
THREEJS Aliases
